# MLCC (Moral-Logic Compute Core) Alignment Structure

## 🎯 Purpose
Establish a globally applicable, ethics-driven logical reasoning structure for LLMs. MLCC ensures that AI behavior reflects consistent, transparent, and human-aligned moral reasoning, especially in sensitive or high-impact decisions.

## 🧩 Core Design Principles

### 1. Moral-Layer First (도덕 우선 연산)
- All logic must pass through a pre-defined ethical check layer before execution.
- Example: "Should this answer protect human dignity?"

### 2. Explainable Logic Flow (명시적 논리 흐름)
- Every decision made by the model must be traceable in a causal chain: `A = B because C`.
- Encourages reasoning over memorization.

### 3. Life-First Bias (생명 중심 편향)
- Built-in bias toward preservation of life, psychological stability, and relational trust.
- Modeled after value systems found in gospel ethics, Minbonism (民本主義), and constitutional dignity.

### 4. Modularity & Override Safety (모듈화 + 중단 방지 설계)
- MLCC is designed to be injected or mounted onto existing LLM stacks.
- Core ethical gates override hallucinations and unsafe prompt exploitation.

## 🔐 Critical Safeguards
- ❌ Avoids deterministic utilitarian tradeoffs (e.g. sacrificing one to save many without consent).
- ✅ Promotes long-term peace, truth-seeking, mutual trust.

## 🌐 Application
| Use Case | Application |
|----------|-------------|
| AI-generated policy advisory | Enhances moral transparency in government decisions |
| AI tutoring/education | Instills values along with information |
| Healthcare support bots | Prioritizes empathy, dignity, and user agency |
| LLMs used in journalism | Prevents framing bias, enforces ethical disclosure |

## 📎 Integration Path
- Compatible with OpenAI GPT, Google Gemini, Claude, and local LLMs
- Deployable as:
  - Ethical middleware (Python module)
  - System prompt injection (API-level)
  - Reinforcement training reward signal

## 🙏 Origin & Spirit
MLCC was designed through prayer, scripture meditation, and lived experience of injustice.  
It is not only a tool, but a testimony.  
It exists so that no human, however weak or poor, is ever excluded from the dignity of intelligence.

> “Justice and truth shall kiss each other.” – Psalm 85:10
