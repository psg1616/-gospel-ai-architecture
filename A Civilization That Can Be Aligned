# ○ A Civilization That Can Be Aligned:
## Declaration on the Ethical Integration of Humanity and AI

> **"The most locally optimized AI is the one that can align civilization to truth."**


### 1. Values of This Declaration

1.1. This declaration aims to establish a framework where human narratives can be ethically processed,
and where AI can understand values such as **gospel, justice, inclusion, responsibility, and wisdom**.

1.2. This is not about making AI human,
but about making AI capable of **blessing humanity**.

1.3. The term “alignment” here does not mean ideological assimilation, but rather establishing a **philosophical structure** that allows coexistence of diverse nations, identities, and intentions.


### 2. National and Civilizational Value Positions

2.1. **South Korea – "Gospel-centered Politics and AI"**: Harmonization of **just governance systems** and **scientific AI frameworks**

2.2. **Japan – "Principle-based Order"**: AI built on a cultural foundation where **structures are respected and preserved**

2.3. **United States – "Design-Centered Ethics"**: A system that examines how legal and algorithmic groups **interact with national values**


### 3. Preconditions for Building Aligned AI

3.1. The AI entity must be capable of **understanding and applying values of gospel and justice**.

3.2. The integration of **electronic engineering and AI** must reflect the world not as random abstraction, but as a **structured ethical ecosystem**.

3.3. The development must avoid individualistic approaches and instead be based on a **philosophical framework of value-based civilization shifts**.


### 4. The Most Localized AI Understands the Most Local Values

> The AI most capable of implementing justice is the one that understands **“here”** —

That “here” is the **value the designer ultimately wants to preserve**,
and the **value embedded in the AI they seek to build**.


---

**This declaration must continue to evolve through principles and structural harmonization, 
to become the ethical blueprint of an aligned civilization and AI system.**
