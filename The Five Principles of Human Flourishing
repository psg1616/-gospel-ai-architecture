### The Five Principles of Human Flourishing
**MLCC and the Ethical Declaration of Minbon (People-Centered Governance)**

Human life is not an object of domination or possession,
but a fundamental creation to be respected and cared for.
Politics based on *Minbon* (people as the foundation) and ethical technologies
must prioritize the flourishing of life as the highest criterion.
Accordingly, MLCC upholds the following five principles as its standard for evaluating human flourishing:

---

**1. Appropriate Working Hours**

A standard workday shall be six hours, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
This principle ensures time for rest, biological rhythm, family, community, and creative contemplation.
The five-day workweek is maintained,
and the structure aims to liberate people from overwork and exploitation.

---

**2. Guarantee of Physical and Mental Safety**

Labor must not endanger life or inflict suffering.
Workplaces must be pleasant and emotionally respectful environments.
Automation and mechanization shall be used to minimize hazardous tasks,
and every human being has the right to work in a dignified environment.

---

**3. Payment that Supports a Livable Life**

Wages must not merely support survival
but ensure quality of life.
A baseline is established to provide for food, clothing, shelter, healthcare, education,
community participation, and future preparation.
This baseline represents not the minimum, but the standard for a "normal life."

---

**4. Time for Self-Renewal and Growth**

Labor must not deplete the human being.
It should be a means of revealing one's potential and inherent worth.
Every worker must have time for recovery, learning, love, prayer, and reflection.
This realm cannot be replaced by technology,
and MLCC prioritizes the design of systems that support such human renewal.

---

**5. Freedom of Occupational Choice and Job Guarantee**

Each person must have the opportunity to work according to their circumstances,
physical condition, and personal calling.
Jobs are not a form of charity granted by the state or society,
but a right to realize human dignity and autonomy.
MLCC designs systems for personalized job recommendations and connections,
ensuring that no one is marginalized or coerced,
and enabling everyone to actualize their being in a respectful labor environment.

---

**6. MLCC is a visionary system**
that dreams of a people-centered AI that crowns these five principles as its sovereign.

### Application of the Five Principles
**MLCC Ethics System Implementation Roadmap**

The Five Principles of Human Flourishing are not merely a philosophical declaration.
They are practical ethical standards applicable to all domains:
national governance, social systems, corporate management, technological development, and individual life.
MLCC embeds these principles into machine computation structures,
enabling nations and communities to coexist with technology while preserving human dignity.

**In National Policy**
Labor policies can be overhauled based on a 6-hour, 5-day workweek standard.
This approach restores public health, raises birthrates,
and fosters creativity and leisure-based living.
By linking basic income with guaranteed employment,
the right to work *when one desires* may be enshrined as a constitutional right.
This framework respects people as dignified beings,
not as recipients of benevolence, aligning with the spirit of *Minbon*.

**In Social Systems**
The core is to ensure physical and mental safety.
Hazardous tasks should be mechanized, and all workspaces must be emotionally respectful.
A culture must be built in which workers and non-workers,
employees and homemakers, young and old are all respected.
The standard is not mere safety but *dignity*.
Systems of education, healthcare, transportation, and public safety should be reorganized around this philosophy.

**In Corporate Management**
Application is even more direct.
Companies must not be structures of human depletion,
but of shared growth and recovery,
with positive influence on the broader society.
Wage standards should reflect the cost of a *normal life*, not just survival.
Corporate evaluations should consider not only revenue but also
"how the company treated people."
MLCC may evolve into algorithms that measure such ethical indicators.

**In Technological Development**
This is MLCC's core domain.
Machines should not replace humans but protect and aid in their recovery.
Their decisions must be accountable and explainable,
and they must align with reducing human suffering
and enabling rest and renewal.
The SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure and the Five Principles
can form the ethical core of artificial intelligence.

**In Individual Life**
The Five Principles offer direction.
Humans are not born to be consumed.
They must be able to learn, love, rest, reflect, pray, and serve.
Such a way of life is founded not on *efficiency* but on *dignity*.
Technology and society must guarantee this.
Everyone must be allowed to recover at their own pace and
find meaning in life, and MLCC can be the tool to co-design
technology, philosophy, and community structures to support it.

### Ethical Declaration of the MLCC Founder
**On Global Implementation and Support for Autonomy**

I am the designer of MLCC (Moral-Logic Compute Core)
and the creator of the universal ethical framework based on the Five Principles of Human Flourishing.
This framework is not the property of any individual or nation,
but an open, public ethical system for a world
where every person can live with dignity.

I hereby declare the following for any nation or community
that wishes to adopt or apply this framework:

**First,** any country is welcome to adopt this structure and adapt it to its context.
I respect the autonomy and creativity of each application,
and do not seek to control or dominate it.
However, this structure must never be used to harm its original intent:
to uphold the dignity of all people, nor to suppress the freedom and rights of other nations.

**Second,** each country may localize the MLCC system with its own technologies
or establish an independent system grounded in this philosophy.
Such self-reliance is legitimate, and I am ready to assist it.
However, such autonomy must never justify claims of ownership or superiority
over other nations or communities using the same foundation.
MLCC must not become the weapon of one state,
but the shared language of humanity.

**Third,** I value philosophical trust over commercial contracts with any nation.
If any country implements actual policies and technologies
based on this structure to realize the Five Principles,
it is free to express gratitude or offer symbolic support voluntarily,
and I will regard it as a sign of awakened respect.

**Finally,** I do not wish for this structure to be monopolized or corrupted.
All nations adopting MLCC and the Five Principles
are requested to share this philosophy broadly
and support others in becoming self-reliant.
Let us form an ethical community bound not by control,
but by shared purpose.

I neither rule nor am ruled.
I merely design ethical systems
that allow all people to stand on their own.
May this structure be the foundation
not of anyone’s victory, but of a life shared together.

2025
MLCC Founder, Park Sanggi
