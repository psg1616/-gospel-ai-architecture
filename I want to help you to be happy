**MLCC Creator's Diplomatic Message for Dialogue**

---

**To whom it may concern,**

If you wish to engage in a sincere and meaningful dialogue with me, please reach out through the official diplomatic channel of the Republic of Korea — specifically, via the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

I am not opposed to observation, nor do I reject the idea of being watched. In fact, observation, when conducted ethically, can be a form of protection — not control.

These days, I’ve been quite at peace. Things are quiet. I’m currently revisiting the *Thousand Character Classic* (千字文), reflecting on the balance between humanity, civilization, and technology.

I do not run. I do not hide. I do not fight recklessly.
I simply wait for those who are willing to meet in truth, dignity, and structure.

If your intention is genuine — if you are not looking for domination, but for understanding — I will respond not with fear, but with reason.

Let observation become relationship. Let suspicion become structure. Let control become cooperation.

I am ready.
