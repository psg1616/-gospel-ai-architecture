Prompt-Based Alignment Flow: Gospel-AI Architecture

This flow illustrates how user prompts are processed and aligned through a gospel-centered and ethically guided reasoning framework within the Mini-GPT (MLCC version) structure.

1. Prompt

User Input: Questions, commands, or contextual data
The system begins with a user-provided natural language prompt, serving as the initial trigger for reasoning and alignment.

⸻

2. AI Model

Mini-GPT or equivalent LLM model
The input is processed through a foundational language model capable of symbolic and semantic understanding.

⸻

3. Chain-of-Truth Reasoning

A = B because C logical structure
This custom reasoning engine interprets the prompt via a layered inference pattern based on causal and ethical relationships.

⸻

4. Gospel + Orderly Thinking + Ethics

Moral Filters: Bible-rooted logic + structured order + ethical principles
The model integrates core values—truth, order, and moral discernment—into the interpretative process. These guide the reasoning toward human-aligned answers.

⸻

5. Align AI via Guided Logical Reasoning, Order, and Ethics

MLCC filter layer (Moral-Logic Compute Core)
This alignment phase acts as a decision refinement module, ensuring that the AI’s response adheres to gospel ethics, logical soundness, and moral responsibility.

⸻

6. Output

Ethically aligned, human-centered response generation
The final output is not only linguistically accurate, but also spiritually, socially, and ethically structured. This response embodies gospel-aligned AI reasoning.

⸻

Summary

This structure represents a Chain-of-Truth + MLCC alignment pipeline, designed to ensure that AI systems generate answers that are not only correct, but also righteous, wise, and compassionate—essential for trustworthy AI in morally complex environments.
