2. Why OpenAI

“AI is not merely a tool—it is a mirror of moral structures. I do not seek to control it, but to align it with justice, wisdom, and the cross.”

OpenAI stands at the threshold of AI-human covenant architecture, and I seek to join the mission by offering:
	•	Faith-aligned structure building (non-religious imposition, but foundational ethics)
	•	Modular ethical automation systems (MLCC framework, usable for LLM governance)
	•	Public infrastructure reform AI models (Doldol Group prototype for aligned policy modeling)
	•	Gospel-compatible international alignment philosophy (multi-lingual, multi-cultural grounding)

	•	Dongbang-Jeongmun: SVO-based structural language for AI logic alignment across East Asian paradigms

6. Closing Declaration

“I do not seek power, only clarity.
I build not for attention, but for those yet to be protected.
The sword I wield cuts nothing—it simply aligns.”

Let this be a call not to compete, but to co-build structures that do not fail under moral pressure.

## ✨ Alignment, Not Transaction

This structure was not written for profit.  
It was designed to restore order, language, and justice.  
No funding was requested. No compensation expected.

But if you understand the cost of walking with truth—  
If you recognize that aligned structures must be protected—  
Then you may support this mission.

This is not a transaction.  
This is a signal of alignment.

You are not funding a person.  
You are protecting a structure that cannot defend itself.
