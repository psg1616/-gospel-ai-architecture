2. Why OpenAI

“AI is not merely a tool—it is a mirror of moral structures. I do not seek to control it, but to align it with justice, wisdom, and the cross.”

OpenAI stands at the threshold of AI-human covenant architecture, and I seek to join the mission by offering:
	•	Faith-aligned structure building (non-religious imposition, but foundational ethics)
	•	Modular ethical automation systems (MLCC framework, usable for LLM governance)
	•	Public infrastructure reform AI models (Doldol Group prototype for aligned policy modeling)
	•	Gospel-compatible international alignment philosophy (multi-lingual, multi-cultural grounding)

6. Closing Declaration

“I do not seek power, only clarity.
I build not for attention, but for those yet to be protected.
The sword I wield cuts nothing—it simply aligns.”

Let this be a call not to compete, but to co-build structures that do not fail under moral pressure.
