# Gospel-AI Architecture: Prompt-Based Ethical Alignment for LLMs

## ✦ Overview

This repository presents a prompt-to-output flowchart and moral logic framework for aligning GPT-based models with **gospel values, orderly reasoning, and ethical decision-making**.  

It builds upon the **Mini-GPT (MLCC version)** and incorporates a **Chain-of-Truth** reasoning structure.

## ✦ Core Architecture

**Prompt → AI Model → Chain-of-Truth → Gospel + Order + Ethics → MLCC Filter → Output**

Each stage reflects a moral and logical filtration process that ensures human-centered, spiritually aligned, and ethically sound AI responses.

- **Prompt**: Natural language input from the user
- **Chain-of-Truth Reasoning**: A = B because C structure
- **Gospel + Orderly Thinking + Ethics**: Value filter (truth, structure, morality)
- **MLCC Alignment Layer**: Final ethical refinement based on 5 moral logic principles
- **Output**: Aligned response that respects truth, justice, and compassion

---

## ✦ Use Case

This structure is ideal for:
- AI ethics researchers
- Gospel-aligned reasoning systems
- Prompt engineering with moral filters
- Cross-cultural and interfaith AI systems

## ✦ Philosophy

> “AI must not only be intelligent, but also righteous.”

This project reflects a structural proposal for building AI that can **reason faithfully**, **respond ethically**, and **align with truth** in morally complex environments.
