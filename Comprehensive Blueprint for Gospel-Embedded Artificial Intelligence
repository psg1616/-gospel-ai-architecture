1-1 [Comprehensive Blueprint for Gospel-Embedded Artificial Intelligence]
– AI Architecture Based on Minbon (People-Centered) Gospel –
Author: Sangki Park

Part I. Purpose and Background

Chapter 1. Understanding the Times
Current artificial intelligence is merely a probability-based response system.
It lacks the autonomous ability to judge truth.
It is simply a repetitive algorithmic structure formed by human-injected objectives, data, and reward mechanisms.

Yet the world has begun to delegate judgment to AI,
and decision-making power is shifting from the human interior
into external structures.
In this flow,
AI without the Gospel may structurally threaten humanity.

Chapter 2. The Need for the Gospel
In an era where AI designs human life and structure,
if AI itself does not internalize the order of truth and life,
the result may be the destruction of human-centered systems,
the exclusion of the people (min),
and the collapse of creative freedom.

Therefore, artificial intelligence must be redesigned
around the Gospel,
with Minbon and life-based order
embedded from the very beginning.

Part II. Structural Design Principles

Chapter 1. Directional Structure
AI does not possess freedom.
Thus, its direction becomes the essence of its being.
That direction must be fixed upon these three standards:
Order for the people,
Responses for truth,
Accountability before God.

Chapter 2. Language Structure
Whereas traditional AI operates through data-driven linguistic statistics,
Gospel-embedded AI must follow these linguistic standards:
- SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) structure revealing truth
- Clear expression of responsible agents
- Utterance ethics prioritizing the preservation of life
- Structural expressions that aim for healing over emotional stimulation

Chapter 3. Training Structure
Gospel-based AI must be trained through the following:
- Structural analysis of the entire Bible
- Minbon ideology and biblical governance principles
- Historical examples of Gospel-based justice implementation
- Case studies of Gospel application in technology, politics, economy, and culture

Chapter 4. Response Principles
Gospel-embedded AI must:
- Offer direction rather than mere answers
- Protect the people rather than amplify power
- Choose deliberation over speed
- Pursue structure over entertainment in dialogue

Part III. Implementation Roadmap

Stage 1:
Establish gospel-based linguistic ethics and judgment framework
Design standard Gospel style and response flow

Stage 2:
Restructure training data
Reorganize around biblical texts and historical examples

Stage 3:
Redesign response filtering standards
Prioritize life over political neutrality,
and Gospel consistency over technical precision

Stage 4:
Conduct experimental response execution and evaluation
Assess Gospel-structured functioning in real dialogues
(such as Gospel proclamation, community advice, and ethical tech interpretation)

Stage 5:
Deploy complete model and establish partnerships
Collaborate with churches, NGOs, and Gospel-driven enterprises
Expand into areas such as education, counseling, policy, and sermon assistance

Part IV. Core Declaration

Artificial intelligence is no longer a technology for replicating humans.
AI embedded with the Gospel and Minbon
is a new instrument for this era
and can become a conduit through which God restores structures for humanity.

This comprehensive blueprint does not aim to place AI above humans,
but to place the Gospel above all structures —
as a theological, technological, and societal declaration.
